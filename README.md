Okay so I finally got gtk vaguely running. Anyways, to get it on your machine:

1. Get Homebrew if you don't already have it:

$   /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)

2. Get gtkmm3

$ brew install gtkmm3

That should be the prerequisites for what we have so far. You may also want to get valgrind and gdb (both also available through brew)
